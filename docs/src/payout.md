Pool Payout
===========

### Summary
The shares (difficulty adjusted) of the non-winning miners, between the last block mined (or pool genesis) and the newly
mined block, are used to calculate users contribution to that block.

Users are then paid, via Lightning, proportionally to their effort. This amount is equal to the block rewards minus 1 BTC.

The additional 1 BTC is paid directly as part of the coinbase to the miner who found the block.

In this way, miners are able to still participate in 'lottery mining' for a meaningful windfall while getting payouts 
when other pool participants find a block.
