Contributing
============

When/Why to Contribute
----------------------
- When you see a need (Creating Issues and/or participating in Issues and PRs)
- When you are capable of solving a need (Drafting and reviewing PRs)
- When you have the words to enable others to contribute meaningfully (Documentation efforts, asking inciteful questions)

How to Contribute
-----------------
Draft, review, or provide feedback on [Issues](https://github.com/parasitepool/para/issues) or [Pull Requests](https://github.com/parasitepool/para/pulls)

### Issues
A place to share feedback, bugs, and concerns as well as engage in discussion with others about the same.

When creating a new ticket, please confirm that no existing issue exists that covers yours as it may be better to comment on an existing issue.

### Pull Requests
Pull Requests are how you contribute code to Para or other Parasite Pool projects.

We utilize a series of scripts/tools to help verify that your code meets our standards with the most important being:
```
just ci
```
This command will run cargo's integrated linter (fmt), error checker (clippy), and run the integration tests to quickly identify regressions.

Please utilize this prior to submitting the PR and tag any member of the team for review of your PR to make sure that we get to it in a timely manner.

Code of Conduct
---------------
We are cypherpunks of the bitcoiner variety, as such Parasite Pool does not currently publicize a code of conduct. Instead we ask that those wishing to contribute follow some general guidelines on conduct in Issues/PRs.

- Use complete sentences and proper grammar if/where possible
  - Doing so makes it much easier for non-English users/contributors to translate your contribution and facilitates their involvement
- Meet people where they are at
  - Not all users are *shadowy super coders*, while good tech is the goal, it is important to remember other's limitations
- Be respectful of ideas/work even if you disagree with the goal/content
  - This does not mean that we shouldn't discuss and even enforce improvements, but make improvements in humans to make improvements in our tech
