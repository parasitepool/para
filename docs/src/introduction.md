Introduction
============

Notes
-----
- A platform for tinkering
- bootstrapping issue, the first block is the hardest
- Bitcoin mining has converged into industrial scale. Current mining hardware is
  probably most dense you can make them (heat/space-efficiency wise but people
  don't realize that you can break up the box into smaller form factors and
  distribute those (home miners). 
- Current mining is overfitted to industrial scale, rigid, capturable
- Mining should be in diverse environments, you should be able to adapt every
  part of it. Nestle into different niches. 
- AI/Superscalars cannot become smaller, they need highly integrated data
  centers connected to a couple hundred megawatts of power. Bitcoin mining can
  be more decentralized, we just have to get it there.
- Fully transparent, auditable, verifiable (merkle tree accumulators for share
  accounting), open-source
- emergent complexity, not inherent
- creating tools for miners so they can verify, get insight. Transparency
- you cannot decentralize which you cannot see
