### **Kolivas** for CKPool:

While it is possible to rebuild pool logic from scratch (as we have begun doing)
your work in open-sourcing an amazing performant and robust implementation of a
Sv1 mining pool helped shortcut so many of the pitfalls by seeing how things
should/do work without needing to spend days reconciling old documentation with
the boots-on-the-ground reality of mining. We chose to do our initial
proof-of-concept as a fork of `ckpool` due to the amazing work that had already
been done. Your efforts and commitment to Bitcoin (mining especially) are
underappreciated and you deserve many more kudos than we can shower you with
here.
